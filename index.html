    <h3>Voice, Vision, and the Antwerp Attitude</h3>
    <p>
      Walter Van Beirendonck occupies a singular position within contemporary fashion. His work is immediately recognisable,
      yet never reducible to style alone. From the outset, his practice has treated fashion as a medium for expression,
      dissent, and imagination, where clothing becomes a carrier of ideas, urgency, and emotion. Colour, text, and silhouette
      are deployed not to decorate the body, but to question it, provoke it, and reframe its place in society. This conceptual
      intensity would become one of the defining forces within the Antwerp Six.

    <h3>Walter Van Beirendonck
    And the antwerp 6</h3>
    <h4>

    </h4>
    <p>
      When the Antwerp Six emerged in the mid-1980s, they did not present themselves as a movement with a unified aesthetic.
      Instead, they appeared as a constellation of individual practices, bound together by attitude rather than form. Within
      this constellation, Walter Van Beirendonck functioned as a critical counterweight.
